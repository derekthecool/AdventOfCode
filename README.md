# Advent Of Code

My advent of code work throughs. My 2022 work was started in your repo which has
been cloned as a submodule to ./2022/fsharp_advent_of_code_2022/ and was done
primarily in fsharp.

## Organization

This repo should be sorted first by year and then by language. For example
for 2023 I am planning on using csharp, fsharp, and lua so it should look like
this:

```
2023
  - csharp
  - fsharp
  - lua
```
